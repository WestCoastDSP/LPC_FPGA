======================================
1) Recorded logic and DSP block utilization for different
    multiplier configurations
2) Added a counter that counts the number of clock cycles
   used for the levinson-durbin algorithm
3) Added the counter to a register in the Avalon-MM 
    interface
4) Added a file of expected output values for the 
    levinson-durbin recursion algorithm.
